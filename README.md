# ECCO_GMSL

ECCO_V4r4_SSH_to_alongtrack.ipynb:
- Samples the gridded SSH from ECCO V4r4 daily fields onto to the x,y points for each ‘cycle day'
- Ran first for two sample years (1992 and 2010)
- The notebook also calculates the ‘true’ global mean sea level and makes a netcdf file, one per year with that time series
